# [PDM Task Provider](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=knowsuchagency.pdm-task-provider)

[**Task**][tasks] provider for [**pdm**][pdm].

## Features

### Task Running

This extension supports running pdm scripts defined in `pyproject.toml` files as [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). Scripts with the name 'build', 'compile', or 'watch'
are treated as build tasks.

To run scripts as tasks, use the **Tasks** menu.

For more information about auto detection of Tasks, see the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_task-autodetection).

### Script Explorer

The PDM Script Explorer shows the pdm scripts found in your workspace. The explorer view is enabled by the setting `pdm.enableScriptExplorer`. A script can be opened or ran, from the explorer.

### Run Scripts from the Editor

The extension supports to run the selected script as a task when editing the `pyproject.toml` file. You can either run a script from
the hover shown on a script or using the command `Run Selected PDM Script`.

### Run Scripts from a Folder in the Explorer

The extension supports running a script as a task from a folder in the Explorer. The command `Run PDM Script in Folder...` shown in the Explorer context menu finds all scripts in `pyproject.toml` files that are contained in this folder. You can then select the script to be executed as a task from the resulting list. You enable this support with the `pdm.runScriptFromFolder` which is `false` by default.

## Settings

- `pdm.autoDetect` - Enable detecting scripts as tasks, the default is `on`.
- `pdm.runQuiet` - Run pdm script with the `--quiet` option, the default is `false`.
- `pdm.packageManager` - The package manager used to run the scripts: `auto`, `npm`. The default is `auto`, which detects your package manager based on files in your workspace.
- `pdm.exclude` - Glob patterns for folders that should be excluded from automatic script detection. The pattern is matched against the **absolute path** of the package.json. For example, to exclude all test folders use '\*\*/test/\*\*'.
- `pdm.enableScriptExplorer` - Enable an explorer view for PDM scripts.
- `pdm.scriptExplorerAction` - The default click action: `open` or `run`, the default is `open`.
- `pdm.enableRunFromFolder` - Enable running PDM scripts from the context menu of folders in Explorer, the default is `false`.
- `pdm.scriptCodeLens.enable` - Enable/disable the code lenses to run a script, the default is `false`.

## TODO

- Clean README
- Clean REPO
- Add screenshots
- Fix `Run script` codelens

## Next steps

- Expose `pdm` commands as tasks (install, update, build, ...)
- Expose `project.scripts` as tasks
- CodeLens on `plugins` to install them automatically
- Setting for custom PDM interpreter path
- Support `poethepoet` with Poetry?
- Writing some tests?
- ~~Support for VS Code in browser?~~
- Support for `help` arguments?
- Cache tasks/`pyproject.toml` with [workspaceState](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext.workspaceState)?

## Recommended extensions

- TOML for validation of pyproject.toml and pdm.toml files.
